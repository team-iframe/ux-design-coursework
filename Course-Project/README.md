    - **Initiatives**
      - **Initiatives page** - create a page, where all Telerik Academy initiatives are listed, and there is a brief description of Telerik Academy
        - This is a brand new page
        - Both for public and authenticated users (if it is applicable)

- Bonus tasks
  - You could make any number of additinal pages by your choice

- For each of the tasks you should use the style guide provided in the folder **_StyleGuide.psd_/_StyleGuide.png_**

##  Task 1: UX

- Improve the user experience of part of http://ui.telerikacademy.com
  - Improve user interaction
  - Improve information architecture
  - Improve the UX for mobile devices

##  Task 2: Design

- Build a new design based on http://ui.telerikacademy.com
  - You can reuse existing components
  - You must limit to the colors from this palette

##  Task 3: Prototype

- Create a simple static prototype using HTML & CSS

## Criteria
- Whole project
  - A straightforward and understandable user flow. 
  - Clear information architecture, visible through the main navigation. Navigation is displayed in a usable way for mobile. 
  - Clear labels and microcopy.  
  - Consider responsive layout rearrangement for mobile. 
  - Clear affordance for the elements  – e.g. buttons, links, etc. Displayed interaction states of the elements and screens. 
  - Clear primary actions for the pages or page sections. 
  - Low interaction cost. 
- Photoshop files
  - Correct unit type must be used e.g. pixels
  - Files must be well organized and structured e.g. proper layer names; good use of groups
  - Use layer comps, if applicable
  - Try to use layers based on types e.g. fill of gradient layers instead of raster layer with color overlay / gradient overlay
- Prototypes
  - Not built with tables
  - Built without using absolute position (absolute position can be used, but not for everything)
  - Responsive means having one page that adapts, no several showing different viewports

## UX Design
- Requirements 
  - Define the goal of the pages you are about to design. List all goals if more than one and order them by priority. 
  - Based on the goal in p.1, create a workflow diagram showing the tasks a user must accomplish within the system. Tasks must be in a sequential order, grouped by scenarios if more than one is available. Show conditional logic if available – e.g. if user is logged or not logged.  
  - Structure and mock up the main site navigation, including the fly-out menus (if you use ones). Consider a specific layout for the responsive view for mobile. 
  - Create low fidelity wireframes for the pages and link them together in a prototype.  Consider responsive layout rearrangement for mobile. You can use a prototyping tool of your choice (e.g. Axure, UXPin, InVision, Balsamiq, Justinmind, other; or plain HTML; or even paper prototypes that are scanned and linked together). 
  - Your wireframes, and particularly your final project, must comply with the 10 usability heuristics. The more boxes you check - the better.  Apply techniques discussed during the lectures for information architecture, interaction design, UI design, mobile design. 
 
## UX Task Deliverables 
  - A short summary of the goal of the designed pages 
  - A workflow diagram 
  - Low-fidelity wireframes stitched in a clickable prototype, including the main navigation. Draft the layout for the navigation in mobile too.
